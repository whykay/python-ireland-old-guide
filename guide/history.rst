History
=======
Founded by Darragh Sherwin in 2004. Group took a Christmas break and no-one met up afterwards. Sean O'Donnell rebooted the meetups in 2005. Soon after quite a lonely meetup by himself, Michael Twomey, Alan Kennedy, Kevin Gill, Michael Kerrin and Vicky Twomey-Lee joined Sean, and met regularly as the core 6 for awhile.

In mid-2005, Vicky took over organising Python Ireland meetups and talks till standing down as Chair in 2012 and Diarmuid Bourke took over as Chair, and Vicky is acting as co-Chair.

In 2010, Python Ireland had their first Irish Python conference called PyCon Ireland, and since then, PyCon Ireland has remained as an annual event. See :ref:`PyCon Ireland <pyconie>` for more details.
