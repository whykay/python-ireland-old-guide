Python Ireland meetups are held on the 2nd Wednesday monthly regardless if there are talks or not. If it's the latter, then a pub meetup is organised instead.

A few things need to be done:-

* Add to `python.ie <http://python.ie/>`_'s *Events* page (get admin access via Michael Twomey)
* Post details to
    * `@PythonIreland <http://twitter.com/pythonireland/>`_ with the hashtag *#PythonIE*
    * `Python Ireland Facebook Group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/20154483464/>`_
        * We have a `Python Ireland Facebook Page <https://www.facebook.com/pages/Python-Ireland/112652892100109?fref=ts>`_ as well, but not used because of lack of time to update.
    * `Python Ireland LinkedIn group <http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Python-Ireland-40749?>`_
    * `Lanyrd <http://lanyrd.com/>`_
        * Add to *Tech events around Ireland* and *Python events around Ireland* Guides
        * Tag topics with *Python*, *Ireland*, *Dublin*
        * Add location, organisers details and details of the meetup (talk or pub)
        * Claim the event so you have additional admin privileges.
