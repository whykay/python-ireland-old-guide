What to look for in a potential venue?
--------------------------------------
* 3 large halls that can hold up to 50-80 people each.
* 1 large hall that can host a plenary session
    * Preferably no joining of existing halls as re-organising the rooms for setting up for plenary session or individual rooms for each track takes considerable amount of time.
* Allows outside catering.
* Allows us to being in our own entertainment (optional).
