What to look for in a potential venue?
======================================
* Can accommodate 250 (max) in one room.
* 3 large halls that can hold up to 50-80 people each.
* 1 large hall that can host a plenary session
    * Preferably no joining of existing halls as re-organising the rooms for setting up for plenary session or individual rooms for each track takes considerable amount of time.
* Allows outside catering.
* Allows us to being in our own entertainment (optional).
* Good wireless for a tech conference. Radisson Blu held up quite well.

Venues we used in the past
==========================

* 2010: Dublin School of English / Capacity: 100
    * Boticelli was the hired caterers for tea/coffee, breakfast and lunch.
* 2011: Radisson Blu Royal Hotel / Capacity: 180
    * Hotel provided food, no outside caterers allowed.
* 2012: Radisson Blu Royal Hotel / Capacity: 200
    * Hotel provided food, no outside caterers allowed.

Venues we enquired in the past
==============================

* Dublin Conference Centre (really expensive, no outside catering, but has all the tech requirements)
* Camden Court Hotel
    * Reasonable, the lobby area is a bit awkward though. The hall size is fine, but need to be split up for rooms and put back together, so not ideal.
    * [TODO] More details and link to 2012 prices.
* Ballsbridge Hotel
    * A bit further out, big halls but smaller rooms might be a problem for workshops.
