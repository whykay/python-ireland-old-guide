PyCon Ireland
=============

PyCon Ireland is an annual Irish Python conference.

The first one was held in 2010 after an enthusiastic drunken (and one undrunken) decision to host one to see if we can, and in the hopes that we will host EuroPython in the near future. So that fateful night in February 2010 in Neary's, we (Mick, Alan, Kevin, Brian and myself)* said we would do it as soon as possible, in July that year. So from scratch, we pulled sponsors, venues and the conference came together with a resound success and we haven't looked back since.
