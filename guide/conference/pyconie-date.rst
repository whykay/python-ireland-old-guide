Choosing a date
===============

Our first conference was held in July but we realised that people are away on holidays and clashing with `PyCon UK <http://www.pyconuk.org/>`_ and `EuroPython <http://europython.eu>`_ didn't quite work out for us at the time.

PyCon Ireland's (second and third) has been held on the second weekend of October because:-

* Avoid clashing with GAA finals at the end of September which can sometimes bleed into early October.
* Try to avoid Octocon which has its own con on either second or third weekend of October.
* Avoid `Gaelcon <http://www.gaelcon.com/>`_ - Ireland's largest gaming convention on October Bank Holiday Weekend.

Things to note when picking dates:

* Not clashing with other PyCons, check `PyCon Events Calendar <http://pycon.org/>`_
* Not clashing with local geek events (check `EventBrite <http://eventbrite.com/>`_, `Lanyrd <http://lanyrd.com>`_, `Eventsden <http://eventsden.com/>`_, `techevents.ie <http://www.techevents.ie/>`_, etc.) [#]_
* July - Summer vacation for many, and students are off college. This is also peak period for travelling and accommodation.
* September to early November are conference months. Late November and December will be going into Christmas party period.
