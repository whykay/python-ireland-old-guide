Lessons Learnt
==============
* We will not have a sprint-dedicated room anymore, people are happy enough to find somewhere and tap away on their laptop. Openspaces will also not be needed, the gathering of people in the lobby areas are enough (as long as there are seatings around).
* Beginners Track is pretty popular.
	* "`Learning Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_" is great for getting people working together and even have seasoned Pythonisatas joining in to assist.
* Have 2 breaks during the day as well as breakfast and lunch.
	* 1 hour break for lunch was a success in 2012. Feedback was positive regarding time to mingle and not having to rush food and head to next set of talks.
* Depending on venues, it seems that maximum 5 sponsor tables is enough else people feel it's just a recruitment fair. We are trying to provide an informal and friendly event.
* We have had entertainment between 2010 and 2012, this is optional. It will also depend on the venue.
