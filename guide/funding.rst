[For PyIE Organisers] Getting funding and sponsorship
===============================================================
Here are associations to contact about funding.

Corporate sponsorship
---------------------
Python Ireland

* Venue
* Food / Drinks (optional)
* Cash

[TODO] More info needed here

[QUESTION] Do we list our past sponsors? python.ie use to have a list of companies that sponsored Python/PyCon Ireland, `an issue has been logged <https://github.com/PythonIreland/website/issues/27>`_.

PSF Funding
------------
There are three ways to get funding:

* Sprint funding - http://pythonsprints.com/
* Outreach and education funding (e.g. intro workshop, diversity workshops) - http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/outreach-and-education
* Other grants, through the main grants program  - http://www.python.org/psf/grants/

[For non-PyIE Organisers] Requests for funding
========================================================
Currently we don't have any process in place for funding Python-related events that are not organised by Python Ireland organisers.

If you want to enquire about possible options, please email contact@python.ie.
